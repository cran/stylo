\title{Contrastive analysis of texts}
\description{
Function that performs a contrastive analysis between two given sets 
of texts. It generates a list of words significantly preferred by 
a tested author (or, a collection of authors), and another list containing 
the words significantly avoided by the former when compared to another set of texts. Some visualizations are available.
}
\usage{
oppose(gui = TRUE, path = "", primary.corpus.dir = "primary_set",
       secondary.corpus.dir = "secondary_set", test.corpus.dir = "test_set")
}
\arguments{
  \item{gui}{an optional argument; if switched on, a simple yet effective 
    graphical interface (GUI) will appear. Default value is \code{TRUE}.}

  \item{path}{if not specified, the current working directory will be used 
    for input/output procedures (reading files, outputting the results, etc.).}

  \item{primary.corpus.dir}{the subdirectory (within the current working directory) that
    contains one or more texts to be compared to a comparison corpus. These texts can e.g. be the oeuvre by author A (to be compared to the oeuvre of another author B) or a collection of texts by female authors (to be contrasted with texts by male authors). If not specified, the default subdirectory \code{primary_set} will be used.}

  \item{secondary.corpus.dir}{the subdirectory (within the current working directory) that
    contains a comparison corpus: a pool of texts to be contrasted
    with texts from the \code{primary.corpus}. If not specified, the default subdirectory 
    \code{secondary_set} will be used.}

  \item{test.corpus.dir}{the subdirectory (within the current working directory) that
    contains texts to verify the discriminatory strength of the features
    extracted from the \code{primary.set} and \code{secondary.sets}. Ideally, the \code{test.corpus.dir} should 
    contain texts known to belong to both classes (e.g. texts written by female 
    and male authors in the case of a gender-oriented study). If not specified, the default subdirectory \code{test_set} 
    will be used. If the default subdirectory does not exist or does not contain
    any texts, the validation test will not be performed.}

\details{
This function performs a contrastive analysis between two given sets of texts, 
using Burrows's Zeta (2007) in its different flavors, including Craig's 
extensions (Craig and Kinney, 2009). Also, the Whitney-Wilcoxon procedure
as introduced by Kilgariff (2001) is available. The function generates 
a vector of words significantly preferred by a tested author, and another 
vector containing the words significantly avoided.
}
\value{
The function returns a list of variables, including a list of words significantly preferred in the primary set, words significantly avoided (or, preferred in the secondary set), and possibly some other results, if applicable.
