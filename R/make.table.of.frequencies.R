# FUNCTION: make.table.of.frequencies
# preparing a huge table with all the frequencies.
# Two arguments are required: (1) text data: either 
# a corpus (list), or a single text (vector); 
# (2) a vector containig the words (a reference word list)
# to rearrange particular frequency list in accordance
# to this vector. Optional argument: (3) absent.sensitive
# which is used to prevent building tables of non-existing
# words. When switched on, the variables that contain but O
# in all samples, will be excluded. Hovewer, in some cases
# this is important to keep all the variables regardless of
# their values. It is the case of comparing two corpora:
# even if a given word did not occur in the whole corpus A,
# it might have occured in the corpus B. In short: if 
# you perform any analysis involving I and II set, switch
# this option to FALSE.
