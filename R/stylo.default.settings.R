#     "English.all": keeps the contractions (as above), and also prevents

# Selection of features. In classical approaches, frequencies of the most

#######  MATHEMATICAL SETTINGS (DISTANCE MEASURE)  #################

# Strictly speaking, the choice of the appropriate distance measure
# is the core of the statistical procedure provided by this script.
# (However, the distance measures do not apply to the PCA method)
# Although this choice is not easy, some of the following measures
# seem to be more suitable for linguistic purposes than others.
# On theoretical grounds, Euclidean Distance and Manhattan
# Distance should be avoided in stylometry. Canberra Distance is quite 
# troublesome but effective e.g. for Latin (it should be combined with 
# careful culling settings and a limited number of MFW taken into analysis). 
# For English, usually Classic Delta is a good choice. A theoretical 
# explanation of the measures implemented in this script is pending.
#
# The available distance measures (choose ONE) are as follows:
#   "CD" --> Classic Delta as developed by Burrows
#   "AL" --> Argamon's Linear Delta (based on Euclidean principles)
#   "ED" --> Eder's Delta (explanation and mathematical equation: soon)
#   "ES" --> Eder's Simple (explanation and mathematical equation: soon)
#   "MH" --> Manhattan Distance (obvious and well documented)
#   "CB" --> Canberra Distance (risky, but sometimes amazingly good)
#   "EU" --> Euclidean Distance (basic, and the most "natural")
